# Honeycomb
A web application to find salons that cater to curly hair built with HTML &amp; SCSS on the front-end &amp; Ruby on Rails on the backend.

## About
It's hard to find a decent salon that caters to curly hair. Natural curls and how to handle them are not usually taught in beauty school and require extra classes, methods and ultimately, money to learn. Curly hair salons are a dime a dozen and many of them are not very affordable for the average user. Some go up to $80 for a haircut!

My goal with Honeycomb is to eventually have a site where a user can have an easy, updated experience with places to go for their curly hair's care (hey, that rhymed!)

## Made With
- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- HTML
- CSS

## Features
- Users can login and signup
- Users can look through all hair salons and hairdressers
- Users can book an appointment and have it saved on their Profile
- Users can look through different wavy/curly hair types (2A-4C)

## Next Steps
- Implementing a handmade database of all the black-owned/natural hair salons in the NYC area. As of now, the data is fictional for seeded use.
- Making sure the appointments can be set by date/time with a calendar
- Additional Styling and making it responsive
